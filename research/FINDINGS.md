# Adaptive focus-stacking — running findings log

Persistent notes from the autonomous marathon. Newest first. Pairs metric numbers
with conceptual reasoning and visual inspection (metrics guide, don't decide).

## F8 — M3 learned per-tile routing beats best-single-tune, MATCHES the oracle
Numpy MLP (8 content features -> best of 6 tunes), trained on GT-supervised dev
labels, deployed feature-only (no GT at inference). Held-out hard collage scenes:
learned routing 0.8580 > best-single-tune 0.8559 > content_aware 0.8554, and it
EQUALS the per-tile oracle upper bound (0.8580). Tile-accuracy is only 54% but
tunes are near-equivalent where confused, so fusion quality saturates near oracle.
Read: per-tile operator/param routing works and is near-optimal, but its CEILING
is small (+0.002 here). Bigger headroom is structural (defocus-spread rejection,
thin-structure isolation), not operator choice -> next focus.

## F7 — Content-aware operator routing = non-regressing best-of-both (promoted)
`content_aware` focus op (blend laplacian/mod_laplacian per pixel by local contrast,
c=1-exp(-ref/tau)): matches laplacian exactly on Real-MFF (0.9913, no regression) and
on defocus_spread, improves smooth-gradient metal (0.9621 vs lap 0.9586; mod 0.9675 is
the ceiling). Hand-tuned tau is a floor for M3 to beat. Committed to the package.

## F6 — Per-tile tune diversity is real; no-GT per-tile labeling is NOT yet reliable
Per-tile best-tune over collage scenes: all 6 candidate tunes win some tiles (GT dist
~[34,22,40,16,25,55]) — strong justification for learned per-region routing. BUT the
composite metric's per-tile best-tune agrees with GT's only ~15% of the time. So the
no-reference metric is fine for GLOBAL ranking (F1) yet too weak to LABEL per-tile tune
choice without GT. Implication: train M3 on GT-supervised dev labels, deploy feature-only
(no GT at inference); closing the no-GT-labeling gap needs metric refinement (future).

## F5 — Composite metric is BLIND (even backwards) on smooth low-texture content
On the `gradient_metal` hard scene (smooth brushed surface, gradual focus), GT-SSIM
ranks **mod_laplacian best (0.9675)** vs laplacian/baseline 0.9586 — a real, distributed
win (14% lower mean error, closer to GT on 57% of pixels). But the **composite metric
ranks baseline ABOVE mod_laplacian** (0.7637 vs 0.7507) — backwards. Cause: q_ssim/q_abf
need structure/edges to grade; on smooth surfaces they can't see the difference.
Consequences: (a) operator selection must be **content-aware**, not purely metric-driven,
for smooth regions; (b) the metric needs a smooth-content term or a fallback. Visual
check: the win is perceptually subtle here (both look near-GT), so this is more a
metric-trust lesson than a big visual gain — but it's exactly the "don't trust the
metric alone" case.

## F4 — Scene-dependence is REAL on hard (disk-defocus) data
Hard benchmark (disk/bokeh PSF, defocus spread, noise, 1024px):
- `gradient_metal`: mod_laplacian > adaptive > baseline (see F5).
- `defocus_spread`: **adaptive best** (GT-SSIM 0.9904 vs 0.9883 baseline), and the
  advantage is larger on the **worst local tile** (0.9719 vs 0.9616, +0.010) — adaptive
  helps most exactly in the hardest region. Local (tiled) metrics reveal wins the global
  mean shrinks.
On clean-Gaussian data (Real-MFF + synth archetypes) operators nearly tie — scene-
dependence only manifests under realistic defocus.

## F3 — Real-MFF is near-ceiling; global tuning has tiny headroom
M1 global search: composite +0.0002, held-out GT-SSIM +0.0003 over baseline (positive,
transfers — objective validated end-to-end, but tiny). laplacian dominates 198/200 scenes.

## F2 — Region-adaptive > global > baseline on GT (monotonic, small)
Held-out Real-MFF: adaptive 0.9897 > global 0.9893 > baseline 0.9889. Premise validated;
magnitude limited by near-ceiling data.

## F1 — Composite objective calibrated & validated (M0)
0.3·Q_ABF + 0.7·Q_SSIM; mean per-pair Spearman vs true GT-SSIM = +0.72. Q_MI was
**rejected** (anti-correlated, +rewards ghosting/speckle). Sharpness alone unreliable.

## Open threads / next
- HIGH-RES: re-run hard benchmark at 2K/4K — do NOT assume 1024 conclusions transfer;
  defocus-spread & thin structures scale with resolution and may reward complex algorithms.
- Content-aware operator selection (smooth -> mod_laplacian) independent of the blind metric.
- Thin-structure ("hair/wire") isolation layer so outliers don't break region partitioning.
- Defocus-spread rejection (consistency check vs sharpest source).
- Metric refinement for smooth/low-texture regions.
